	<h1>Printmaking</h1>

<body>
	<p> Printmaking is the process of creating 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_of_art">artworks</a> 
		by printing, normally on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper">paper</a>
		, but also on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile">fabric</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood">wood</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal">metal</a>, and other surfaces. <i>"Traditional printmaking"</i> normally covers only the process of creating prints using a hand processed technique, rather than a photographic reproduction of a visual artwork which would be printed using an electronic machine (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)">printer</a>); however, there is some cross-over between traditional and digital printmaking, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risograph">risograph</a>.</p>
	<p> Except in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotyping">monotyping</a>, all printmaking processes have the capacity to produce identical multiples of the same artwork, which is called a print. Each print produced is considered an "original" work of art, and is correctly referred to as an "impression", not a "copy" (a different print that copies the first, common in early printmaking). </p>
	<p> However, impressions can vary considerably, whether intentionally or not. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_printmaker">Master printmakers</a> are technicians who are capable of printing identical "impressions" by hand. Historically, many printed images were created as a preparatory study, such as a drawing. A print that copies another work of art, especially a painting, is known as a "reproductive print".</p>
		<p> Prints are created by transferring ink from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(printing)">matrix</a> to a sheet of paper or other material, by a variety of techniques. Common types of matrices include: metal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching">etching</a> plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates and other thicker plastic sheets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving">engraving</a> or etching; stone, aluminum, or polymer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography">lithography</a>; blocks of wood for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut">woodcuts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_engraving">wood</a> engravings; and linoleum for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linocut">linocuts</a>. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing">screen printing</a> process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.</p>
		<p> Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_(printmaking)">edition</a>. Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition; the matrix is then destroyed so that no more prints can be produced. Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist%27s_book">artist's books</a>.
